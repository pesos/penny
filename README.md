![Penny, from TBBT](http://glueimg.s3.amazonaws.com/stickers/huge/warner_bros_television/the_big_bang_theory_penny.png)

A fork of phenny from [Sean B. Palmer](http://inamidst.com/sbp/)

The bot has been customized to run as a logger for the IRC channel of [PES Open Source Community](http://pesos.github.com/), [#pes-os](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pes-os). The bot is called 'penny' 'cos we love [TBBT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory) and [Penny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(The_Big_Bang_Theory)! 

##Installation

1. Get the source of penny
2. Run as `./phenny`

**Note**: *The logs are saved in a file called pes-os.log in the same directory as phenny*

##Usage

`.logs <n>`

This command in the channel generates a [paste.kde.org](http://paste.kde.org) link with the last 'n' lines from the channel `#pes-os`

If the argument is missing, it generates a paste of the entire log from the beginning. This is not guaranteed to be fast.
