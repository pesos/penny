A fork of phenny from Sean B. Palmer, http://inamidst.com/sbp/

The bot has been customized to run as a logger for the IRC channel of PES Open Source Community, #pes-os. The bot is called 'Penny' 'cos we love TBBT and Penny! 

Installation :
1) Get the source of phenny
2) Run ./phenny

Note : The logs are saved in a file called pes-os.log in the same directory as phenny 

Usage : 
.logs <n>

This command in the channel generates a paste.kde.org link with the last 'n' lines from the channel #pes-os

If the argument is missing, it generates a paste of the entire log from the beginning. This is not guaranteed to be fast.
